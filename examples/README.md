This folder contains a few examples.

All were created from templates generated by `tmake`.

## `palindrome.c`: Palindromes of `(a|b)+`

This Turing machine accepts palindromes of `a` and `b`.

According to the transition table, the machine itself should accept `(a|b)*`, but C's `scanf("%s")` will fail to read an empty string, thus the resulting executable accepts `(a|b)+` (using PCRE notation).

### Examples

```
input> abbaba

[...]
_______________________xxxaxx___________

Reject done
```
```
input> abbabba

[...]
______________________xxxxxxx___________

Accept done
```


## `add.c`: Binary adder

This machine takes two integers in binary and adds them together, overwriting the leftmost one.

As it is impossible to erase the right number, it is left as 0.

### Examples

```
input> 100101 111

___________________100101_111_________
[...]
___________________101100_000___________

Accept done
```
```
input> 1111111 111

__________________1111111_111___________
[...]
_________________10000110_000___________

Accept done
```

## `sort.c`: Gnome sort

Enter a series of integers between 0 and 31 (both included) in base 10, and the machine will sort them in ascending order. The C code that manages the tape input will stop reading as soon as an invalid value is read.

It is easy to make this work for bigger integers, but as input needs to be left-padded, and in binary, extending the range of integers that can be sorted will reduce the number of them that can fit on the printed portion of the tape.

The length of the displayed tape has already been increased, and can be extended even more by reducing the font of the terminal.

As provided, the machine can display up to 26 integers at once (which seems to be a good compromise between a wide range of values and a large number of them), but this value can be increased or decreased depending on the number of bits per value and the length of the printed tape.

### Examples

```
input> 5 1 4 3 2 0 -1
