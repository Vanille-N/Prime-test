This folder contains a few examples.

All were created from templates generated by `tmake`.

## `palindrome.c`: Palindromes of `(a|b)+`

This Turing machine accepts palindromes of `a` and `b`.

According to the transition table, the machine itself should accept `(a|b)*`, but C's `scanf("%s")` will fail to read an empty string, thus the resulting executable accepts `(a|b)+` (using PCRE notation).


## `add.c`: Binary adder

This machine takes two integers in binary and adds them together, overwriting the leftmost one.

As it is impossible to erase the right number, it is left as 0.
